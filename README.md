# Music-Player-Using-Data-Structures


Basic Music Player
This project is developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course (CSE2003). It implements a Basic Music Player in C++ by leveraging several data structures to manage and navigate through songs. The goal is to apply knowledge of data structures to create an efficient and functional music player.

Features
Data Structures Used:

Doubly Linked List: To navigate through songs with ease (next and previous functionality).

Stacks: To handle history (previously played songs).

Queues: To manage playlists or upcoming songs.

File Handling: Reads songs from a file and saves song data for easy access.

How It Works

The music player uses doubly linked lists to store songs, allowing users to move forward and backward through the playlist.

Stacks manage song history, enabling users to view or replay previously played songs.

Queues handle upcoming songs, letting users enqueue songs they want to listen to next.

File handling is used to read and write song data, so the player can load songs at startup and save changes on exit.

Prerequisites

C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

Command Line Tools (macOS) or equivalent for compiling C++ code
